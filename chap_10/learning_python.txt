I have learned how to install the python program on defferent systems 
sach as windows linux and, or mac.
In python i can user variables and simple datatypes.
I can work with lists, use if statements, dictionaries.
I can get the user input and use the while loops.
I can use functions, classes.
And now i am working on files and exceptions.
