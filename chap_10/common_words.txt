Apparently not, for this same course had been playing to packed houses in New
York City every season for the preceding twenty-four years. During that time, more
than fifteen thousand business and professional people had been trained by Dale
Carnegie. Even large, skeptical, conservative organizations such as the
Westinghouse Electric Company, the McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, the
Brooklyn Union Gas Company, the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, the
American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the New York Telephone
Company have had this training conducted in their own offices for the benefit of
their members and executives.
The fact that these people, ten or twenty years after leaving grade school, high
school or college, come and take this training is a glaring commentary on the
shocking deficiencies of our educational system.
What do adults really want to study? That is an important question; and in order to
answer it, the University of Chicago, the American Association for Adult
Education, and the United Y.M.C.A. Schools made a survey over a two-year period.
That survey revealed that the prime interest of adults is health. It also revealed that
their second interest is in developing skill in human relationships - they want to
learn the technique of getting along with and influencing other people. They don’t
want to become public speakers, and they don’t want to listen to a lot of high
sounding talk about psychology; they want suggestions they can use immediately in
business, in social contacts and in the home.
So that was what adults wanted to study, was it?
“All right,” said the people making the survey. "Fine. If that is what they want,
we’ll give it to them.”
Looking around for a textbook, they discovered that no working manual had ever
been written to help people solve their daily problems in human relationships.
Here was a fine kettle of fish! For hundreds of years, learned volumes had been
written on Greek and Latin and higher mathematics - topics about which the
average adult doesn’t give two hoots. But on the one subject on which he has a
thirst for knowledge, a veritable passion for guidance and help - nothing!
This explained the presence of twenty-five hundred eager adults crowding into the.
